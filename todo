having a function that will take a packet, determine if it is encrypted, determine if it is decryptable using
    any information we have (SSID Password pair/EAPOL handshakes), and return the decrypted packet will make our lives
    so much easier.

    Anyone know how to decrypt WPA?

dot11decrypt subprocess can't be killed without sudo privileges :/

dot11decrypt parsing tap interface name from stdout could be improved. right now i'd say it's pretty ripe for failure in most cases

currently looking for better code to determine type of encryption. right now my requirement to determine wpa is if it has RSN (which is only WPA2)
    cause I don't see much WPA networks lol. then i say it uses WEP when it doesn't have RSN and AP can support WEP flag is set (yeah,stupid i know)

dot11decrypt doesn't seem to work on myWiFi WEP. will look for other WEP networks to try. geez, why are there still even WEP networks. -__-
