having a function that will take a packet, determine if it is encrypted, determine if it is decryptable using
    any information we have (SSID Password pair/EAPOL handshakes), and return the decrypted packet will make our lives
    so much easier.

    Anyone know how to decrypt WPA?

dot11decrypt subprocess can't be killed without sudo privileges :/

dot11decrypt parsing tap interface name from stdout could be improved. right now i'd say it's pretty ripe for failure in most cases
