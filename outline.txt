check if interface is available
if not, prompt to start airmon-ng
once started, lock on to specified channel
start master sniffer
    determine/display communicating access points and stations (if an AP is not communicating with anyone it will not be
      displayed. Use the aircrack-ng suite if you want all signals. This is to simply sniff communication between devices
      and access points)
    start sniffer (with filter) for each pair?
    Each pair must hold the following (continuously updated) information:
        SSID of access point
        Time of last communication
        Is it one-sided? (Can you only hear the access point, the device, or both?)
        Number of packets sent back and forth between the two. (of course, some may be retransmissions)
        Is it encrypted? (Most likely yes)
        Is it readable?
            For WPA and WPA2:
                Are the SSID and password for the access point known? (stored in the database)?
                Have sufficient EAPOL packets been captured for decryption? If not, give an option to run aireplay and
                  deauth the user
            For WEP:
                Is the WEP key known?
