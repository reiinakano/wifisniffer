check if interface is available
if not, prompt to start airmon-ng
once started, lock on to specified channel
start master sniffer in pyshark
    determine/display communicating access points and stations (if an AP is not communicating with anyone it will not be
      displayed. Use the aircrack-ng suite if you want all signals. This is to simply sniff communication between devices
      and access points)

    Each access point must hold the following information (not visible to user):
        Are the SSID and password for the access point known? (stored in the database)?
            If so, start a dot11decryptprocess for that particular SSID and password pair (if not started already)
            If not, give user option to input password for the access point

    Each pair must hold the following (continuously updated) information:
        Access point
        Time of last communication
        Is it one-sided? (Can you only hear the access point, the device, or both?)
        Number of packets sent back and forth between the two. (of course, some may be retransmissions)
        What is the type of encryption?
        Number of decrypted packets so far
        If not, give an option to run aireplay and
          deauth the user
